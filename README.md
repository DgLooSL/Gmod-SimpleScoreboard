**This is a scoreboard mod I created for GMod. I've redesigned the scoreboard interface, keeping all the original features while adding some new small but useful functionalities.**</br></br>
Side note: This is my first mod for GMod. I started learning by watching [**DanFMN's**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLN1e9kVZIWewR9Tm48zbxdm1qiBEWYpJI) tutorials, and due to my limited experience, there might be some inefficiencies and messy code structure. I hope you can understand and bear with me!
