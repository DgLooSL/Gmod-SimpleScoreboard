**This is a scoreboard mod I created for GMod. I've redesigned the scoreboard interface, keeping all the original features while adding some new small but useful functionalities.**</br></br>
**Side note:** This is my first mod for GMod. I started learning by watching [**DanFMN's**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLN1e9kVZIWewR9Tm48zbxdm1qiBEWYpJI) tutorials, and due to my limited experience, I used AI assistance for some features I wasn't familiar with. The code structure might be a bit messy, and there could be some inefficiencies. I hope you can understand me!
